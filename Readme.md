## 💡 Key DAX Measures Used

---

### 🎯 **1. Target Achievement Logic**

```DAX
TargetStatus = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    [Sales] >= [Target], "Achieved",
    [Sales] >= [Target] * 0.75, "Partial",
    "Not Achieved"
)
```

🔹 Used to apply conditional formatting in the Target dashboard.

---

### 🧪 **2. What-If Discount Simulation**

```DAX
Profit After Discount = 
[Sales Amount] - ([Sales Amount] * 'Discount Parameter'[Discount %])
```

🔹 Enables dynamic simulation of discount impact on profitability.

---

### 👥 **3. RFM Score – Customer Segmentation**

```DAX
RFM Score = 
VAR Recency = ...
VAR Frequency = ...
VAR Monetary = ...
RETURN
Recency + Frequency + Monetary
```

🔹 Used to classify customers as Loyal, At Risk, Lost, or New.

---

### 📈 **4. YoY Sales % Change**

```DAX
YoY Sales % Change = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Sales] - CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])),
    CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
)
```

🔹 Used in KPI cards to show year-over-year sales growth or decline.

---

### 🏅 **5. Top 5 Salespersons by Segment**

```DAX
Top5 Salespersons = 
RANKX(
    ALLSELECTED('Salesperson'),
    [Total Sales],
    ,
    DESC
)
```

🔹 Enables dynamic leaderboard visuals for spotlighting performance.
